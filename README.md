## 📚 Project Overview

This is a simple project that simulates a book adding system. You can add a book by specifying the title of the book, the author of the book and ther ISBN number.
It then adds the book to the list that is dynamically created in the DOM. You can also remove the book from the list. I also make use of local storage. This allows the books that you have added or removed to still be displayed in the list upon refreshing or reloading the page. The project is very simple. 
The point was to create the project using es5 and es6 versions of javascript using classes to demonstrate OOP (object oriented programming). Hence, there are two sets of 'index.html' files and 2 sets of 'app.js' files. One set for es5 and es6 respectively. Everything was done in vanilla javascript and basic html with a css framework for the form. (NOTE: only the es6 version makes use of the local storage functionality.)
